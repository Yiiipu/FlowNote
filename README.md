# FlowNote
The simplest yet clever Mac menubar note.
Simply type in your notes. No navigation. No button click. No category search. New text field generates automatically for your next input. All notes are listed in time flow.

Tags are generated automatically if you right click the note block and select Add Tags (OpenAI API needed for this function). You can use the tag system and keywords to search your notes.
