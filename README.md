# FlowNote
The **simplest yet clever** Mac menubar note.

Simply type in your notes. No navigation. No button click. No category search. New text field generates automatically for your next input. All notes are listed in time flow.

Although the note-taking is simple and fluent, **searching for previous notes is never a pain**. FlowNote supports two ways of searching for previous notes:

1. Tags can be generated automatically (with OpanAI API) for each note. You can use tag and keywords to filter the notes.
2. Simply type in your question about your note base. AI assistant will perform semantic search of the note base and give you the answer. 

Other functions including get instant answers to any questions (powered by ChatGPT), mark/unmark important notes, set reminder for time-sensitive notes, and markdown support. See a video of how it [operates](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/13wvt81/simplest_yet_cleverest_mac_menubar_note_designed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1). This video is for FlowNote v1.0.

This is the [download link](FlowNote_v1.3.dmg). **This is the newest version notarized by Apple**. It will be open sourced after several updates.

**Update v1.1**

Now you can set a reminder for one note by right-click and select "Remind me...". For example, you can have it remind you what to do after 2 days, or you can use it as a pomodoro. There are many other possibilities.

**Update v1.2**

1. UI is improved.
2. Dark mode is supported.
3. Now you can mark/unmark a note by right-click and select "Mark"/"Unmark". A red dot will be added to that note to make it more visible. I use it to mark the note that I need to revisit in near future.
